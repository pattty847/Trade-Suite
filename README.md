# Trade-Suite, a small trading client side project. Lots more to come. 

## To run the application. 

**Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your virtual environment.**

**Go to **main.py** and run python script.**

As of now, I have started to re-write the Exchagne.py file without using **ccxt**. Maybe, I can keep it available and slowly migrate the exchanges to their new files. Each exchange will be implimented directly to the exchange with asyncio requests and websockets.
